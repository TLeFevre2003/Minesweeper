# Overview

For this project I wanted to create a project in .NET MAUI. I have been interested in learning .NET MAUI for a long time and I thought this was the perfect 
opportunity to give it a try. MAUI interests me because it is a cross platform framework for building apps.

The software I wrote is a minesweeper game. Basically it spawns a grid of squares that have mines and each square says the number of mines
adjacent to it. Using that information you need to click all the squares that aren't mines.

I wrote this software because it is a game I am familiar with so it was the perfect choice for learning a new framework.
It helped me so when testing I knew if something was off, and I knew what parts were important to focus on.

# Development Environment

The tools I used to create this software was visual studio community 2022 edition. I also used the 
pre configured MAUI application templates which helped a lot in getting started.


The programming language MAUI uses is C# along with XAML which is how the UI is built. I also used MAUI which is the framework it is built on.

# Future Work



- Make it so you can mark flags. High priority but difficult. Maybe explore holding shift lets you flag.
- Make clicking a bomb actually make you lose the game.
- Add Some counters for how many tiles have been revealed and how many bombs are left.
